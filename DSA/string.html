    <p class="question">Removes the outermost parentheses</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">This method removes the outermost parentheses from each group of balanced parentheses in the input string. It uses a variable called <span class="code">depth</span> to keep track of how deep we are inside nested parentheses.<br>As we go through the string:</p>
    <ul style="margin: 0px;">
        <li>When we see <span class="code">&#39;(&#39;</span>, we increase the depth. If we are already inside (<span class="code">depth > 0</span>), we add it to the result because it's not the outermost opening bracket.</li>
        <li>When we see <span class="code">&#39;)&#39;</span>, we first decrease the depth. If we are still inside (<span class="code">depth != 0</span>), we add it to the result because it's not the outermost closing bracket.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">This way, we skip the first and last parentheses of every primitive group, effectively removing their outer layer.</p>
    <pre style="margin: 0px;"><code class="language-java" style="border-radius: 10px;">public static String removeOuterParentheses(String input) {
    
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    int depth = 0;  // Tracks current level of nesting

    for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
        
        if (c == &#39;(&#39;) {
            depth++; // Going deeper into nesting
            if (depth &gt; 1) {
                result.append(c); // Not the outermost &#39;(&#39;, so keep it
            }
        } else if (c == &#39;)&#39;) {
            depth--; // Coming out of nesting
            if (depth != 0) {
                result.append(c);
            }
        }

    }

    return result.toString();
}</code></pre>
    <p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 5px;">We use <span class="code">StringBuilder</span> to build the result because it is much faster than using a regular String when repeatedly adding characters. Strings in Java are immutable, so every time you use <span class="code">+</span> with a String, a new object is created, which is slow and uses more memory. StringBuilder avoids this by modifying the existing object, making it more efficient.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">We use <span class="code">StringBuilder</span> instead of <span class="code">StringBuffer</span> because we are not dealing with multiple threads here — StringBuilder is faster in single-threaded code since it doesn't have the overhead of thread safety.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The code goes through the string only once, so it works fast (O(n) time), and it doesn't use any extra space except for the result (O(n) space).</p>
    <br>
    <p class="question">Check if two strings have a common substring</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">The method checkCommonSubstring determines whether two strings share at least one common character. It begins by creating a <span class="code">HashSet</span> to store all characters from the first string, s1. As it loops through each character in s1, it adds them to the set using the <span class="code">add()</span> method. After this, it iterates through each character in the second string, s2, and uses the <span class="code">contains()</span> method to check if the character exists in the set. If a common character is found, the method returns true immediately. If no match is found after checking the entire second string, it returns false.</p>
    <pre style="margin-top: 5px 0px 0px 0px;"><code class="language-java" style="border-radius: 10px;">public static boolean checkCommonSubstring(String s1, String s2) {
    Set&lt;Character&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();

    for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {
        set.add(c); // Store all characters of s1
    }

    for (char c : s2.toCharArray()) {
        if (set.contains(c)) {
            return true; // Common character found
        }
    }

    return false; // No common character found
}</code></pre>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 5px;">In terms of performance, the <span class="code">add()</span> and <span class="code">contains()</span> methods of HashSet generally operate in constant time, <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(1)</b>, on average. This efficiency comes from the underlying hash table implementation, which allows for direct indexing based on the hash of the elements. However, in the worst-case scenario—when too many hash collisions occur—these operations can degrade to <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(n)</b> time. This happens when multiple elements are mapped to the same hash bucket, turning the underlying data structure for that bucket into a linked list or a balanced tree, depending on the Java version. Although such cases are rare due to good hashing strategies, it is still important to be aware that the worst-case performance of both add() and contains() is O(n).</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;">So, in typical situations, building the set from the first string takes <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(n)</b> time, and checking each character in the second string also takes <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(m)</b> time, leading to an average-case total time complexity of <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(n + m)</b>. But in the worst case, due to excessive collisions, the time complexity can degrade to <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(n × m)</b>. The space complexity remains <b style="font-size: 95%;">O(n)</b> since up to all characters of s1 may be stored in the set.</p>
