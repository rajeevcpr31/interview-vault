    <p class="question">Reason for Job Change?</p>
    <p class="answer">I have learned a lot in my current job and grown both personally and professionally. However, now that the core part of our project is complete and the work mainly involves maintenance and minor updates, I feel it's the right time to take the next step in my career. I am seeking a role where I can apply what I have learned, continue growing, and contribute to more complex and meaningful challenges.</p>
    <p class="question">Expected Salary</p>
    <p class="answer">At this stage, I do not have a full understanding of the role and responsibilities, so I feel it is a bit early to give an exact number. I would appreciate it if you could share the budgeted salary range for this position.<br>I am looking for a fair and competitive salary that reflects my experience and skills. Based on what I understand about the role so far and some research, I would expect something in the range of 'X' to 'Y' LPA. Of course, I am open to discussing this further once I have a clearer understanding of the responsibilities and expectations. In addition to compensation, I also value continuous learning, career growth, and the opportunity to work on real challenges.</p>
    <p class="question">What is your notice period?</p>
    <p class="answer">My official notice period is two months, but if needed, I can try to reduce it to one month by discussing it with my current employer. I believe in clear communication and working together to find a solution that works well for both sides.</p>
    <p class="question">Do you have any offers in hand?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, I am currently exploring opportunities and actively interviewing, but I don't have any offers at the moment. I am genuinely interested in this role and feel it's a great fit for my skills.</p>
